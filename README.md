CECIL GROUP EMPLOYEE ATTRITION ANALYSIS INSIGHTS


Employee turnover is a significant challenge for organizations, impacting continuity, morale, and operational costs. A recent analysis of employee attrition within a company provides insight into patterns that can inform strategies to improve retention. By examining factors such as salary brackets, tenure, job satisfaction, and educational background, we can better understand what drives employees to leave and what actions may help keep them engaged.

Key Observations on Employee Attrition

Salary and Attrition
The analysis reveals that employees earning between $2,000 and $3,000 are most likely to leave, with 96 individuals in this range having left the company. They are followed by employees earning between $4,000 and $5,000 (26 individuals) and those earning $3,000 to $4,000 (24 individuals). For comparison, the companyâ€™s total workforce is 1,480, highlighting that a noticeable portion is leaving within specific income brackets.

Income Levels Across Roles
The company's highest earners average an income of $17,182, whereas Sales Representatives, among the more frequent roles to experience attrition, average a much lower income of $2,630. This disparity highlights the need to investigate income satisfaction and career growth within lower-paying roles, as this could be contributing to turnover.

Attrition by Age Group
Younger employees, particularly those aged 26-35, have the highest turnover rates, followed by employees aged 18-25. This trend is common in many industries, where younger employees seek rapid growth and may switch roles if their expectations are unmet.

Salary Hikes and Tenure
Employees with 6-11 years of tenure have received the highest salary increases over time, with an average hike of 43%. In contrast, those with 36-41 years of service received minimal increases, with only a 0.9% hike, and those aged 30-35 received a 2.37% increase. This inconsistency can lead to dissatisfaction, particularly among long-serving employees who feel undervalued.

Job Satisfaction Variances by Role
Sales Executives report high job satisfaction, potentially due to their relatively competitive pay compared to other roles. On the other hand, HR employees report the lowest job satisfaction. As HR plays a critical role in shaping organizational culture and supporting employees, low morale in this department could have broader implications for the organization.

Degree Field and Salary
Educational background also correlates with income levels. Employees with degrees in Life Sciences, Medical, and Marketing fields are among the top earners, while those in Human Resources and other degrees tend to have lower salaries. These income gaps can influence employees' perceptions of fairness and satisfaction in the workplace.

Recommendations for Improving Retention

Based on these findings, the following recommendations can help address areas contributing to attrition and enhance employee retention.

Address Salary-Related Attrition
Revising the pay structure for lower-paying roles with high attrition rates can create more equity across the organization. This may include implementing structured salary progression tied to performance and tenure. Additionally, exit interviews should be conducted regularly to better understand the specific salary-related concerns of departing employees.

Enhance Career Growth and Salary Hike Policies
Consistent, moderate salary increases for long-tenured employees can help reduce the perception of stagnation. Offering structured and predictable raises for employees with shorter tenures (0-5 years) may also improve engagement, encouraging them to stay longer and grow within the organization.

Focus on Retention for Younger Employees
To retain younger employees, the company should consider creating mentorship programs and offering more growth opportunities aligned with their career goals. Training programs, competitive salaries, and clear promotion paths can foster loyalty and help employees visualize a long-term future with the organization.

Boost Job Satisfaction in HR and Low-Satisfaction Roles
Addressing the sources of dissatisfaction in HR could involve improving recognition for contributions, refining job roles, and offering professional development. Such changes could boost HR morale, creating a more supportive environment that positively affects the broader employee experience.

Review Degree-Based Salary Structures
While education level may factor into pay, employees across all degree fields should have access to similar opportunities for advancement and skills development. Specialized training and cross-functional opportunities could help employees in lower-paying degree fields find paths to higher earnings and greater satisfaction, fostering a sense of inclusion and opportunity throughout the organization.

By taking these targeted actions, the company can reduce turnover and build a more satisfying, equitable, and engaging workplace that supports long-term employee success. This proactive approach will strengthen organizational stability and create an environment where employees feel valued, motivated, and committed to the company's mission.
